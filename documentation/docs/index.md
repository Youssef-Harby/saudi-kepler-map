# Building Map app with Kepler.gl

## :material-chevron-right-circle: Introduction

In this guide, you shall learn how to build and visualize a large amount of location data in your browser using [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

Kepler.gl is designed for geospatial data analysis. It allows technical and non-technical audiences to visualize trends in a city or region.

### :material-buffer: Live Samples:

[![Saudi Kepler's map](imgs/saudi_kepler_map.png "Go to Saudi Kepler's map")](http://mapapps.cloud:7070/)

[![New York City Population](imgs/us_instance.png "Go to New York City Population")](https://kepler.gl/demo/nyc_census)

You will be able to perform data analysis in Kepler.gl by adding data to a map, fetching layers from a web service (e.g. [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)), adding filters, and more cool features to explore.

!!! tip
    It's highly recommended before going through how to use Kepler.gl in ReactJs, to explore and interact with [Kepler.gl's demo](https://kepler.gl/demo). Use one of the samples that are available to be used and add it to the map.
